## A $ 50.0-g $ piece of aluminum has a net charge of $ +4.20 μС $. Aluminum has an atomic mass of $27.0 g/mol$, and its atomic number is $13$.
1. Calculate the number of electrons that were removed from the initially neutral aluminum to produce this charge.
- $ N = \frac{Q}{e} $
2. Determine what fraction of the original number of electrons this removed number represents.
3. By how much did the original mass of the aluminum decrease after charging?
