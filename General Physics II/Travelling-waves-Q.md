Direction = negative x-direction.

2. A woman sees a jet fighter plane directly overhead and then hears a sonic boom 4.0 s later. If the planeâ€™s altitude is 2000 m, assuming the speed of sound is 330 m/s and ignore any potential effects due to refraction of the sound, calculate the Mach number of the jet fighter plane.
    - $ M = \frac{v}{v_s} $
    - $ v_s = 330 \, \text{m/s} $
    - $ v = \frac{2000 \, \text{m}}{4.0 \, \text{s}} = 500 \, \text{m/s} $
    - $ M = \frac{500}{330} $
