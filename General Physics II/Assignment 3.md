1. Laser light with wavelength of $ 500 \, \text{nm} $ is incident on 2 slits of width $ 1.0 \, \mu\text{m} $ and the slits are $ 8.0 \, \mu\text{m} $ apart. 
    1.1. Determine how many bright fringes are within the central maximum of the diffraction pattern. 
    1.2. Determine how many bright fringes are within the first side peak of the diffraction pattern. 
    1.3. Draw the diffraction pattern.
2. A plastic lens is coated on the outside with a thin film of graphene to prevent the transmission of UV light with wavelength, $ \lambda = 250 \, \text{nm} $ from the lens surface. The index of refraction of graphene is $ 1.30 $; that of the plastic is $ 1.58 $. What is the minimum graphene coating thickness that blocks the transmission of the UV light with wavelength $ \lambda = 250 \, \text{nm} $?
