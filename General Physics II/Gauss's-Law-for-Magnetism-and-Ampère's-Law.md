- How do we state formally that no magnetic monopoles have been observed?
- How do we use Ampère’s law and Maxwell–Ampère’s law to find the magnetic fields produced by different sources?

- This magnetic case is most similar to the electric dipole, among the usual suspects
- The magnetic dipole could be due to a current loop or permanent magnet
- Gauss’s law for electricity: $ 
\Phi_E = \oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{q_{in}}{\epsilon_0} $
- Gauss’s law for magnetism: $\Phi_B = \oint \vec{B} \cdot d\vec{A} = 0 $
