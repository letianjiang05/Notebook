65. A coaxial cable is constructed from a central cylindrical conductor of radius $r_A = 1.00 \, \text{cm}$ carrying current $I_A = 8.00 \, \text{A}$ in the positive x direction and a concentric conducting cylindrical shell with inner radius $r_B = 14.0 \, \text{cm}$ and outer radius $r_C = 15.0 \, \text{cm}$ with a current of $20.0 \, \text{A}$ in the negative x direction (Fig. P31.65). What are the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field 
    1. at point O, a distance of 10.0 cm from the center of the coaxial cable along the y axis, and 
    2. at point P, a distance of 20.0 cm from the center of the coaxial cable along the y axis?
