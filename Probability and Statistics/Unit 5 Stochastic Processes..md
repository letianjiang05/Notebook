# 5.1 Basic Concepts of Stochastic Processes
Let $ S(t) $ be the stock price at time $ t \geq 0 $.

## Random Process
A __random process__ is a collection of random variables indexed by time or indexed by space.

## Mean Function
For a random process $ S(t) $, the __mean function__ is defined as:
$$ m(t) = E[S(t)] $$
where $ E[\cdot] $ is the expectation operator.
