# 11.1 Sorting algorithms
## 11.1.1 Evaluation dimensions
- Execution efficiency: We expect the time complexity of sorting algorithms to be as low as possible, as well as a lower number of overall operations (lowering the constant term of time complexity). For large data volumes, execution efficiency is particularly important.
- In-place property: As the name implies, in-place sorting is achieved by directly manipulating the original array, without the need for additional helper arrays, thus saving memory. Generally, in-place sorting involves fewer data moving operations and is faster.
- Stability: Stable sorting ensures that the relative order of equal elements in the array does not change after sorting.


# 11.2 Selection sort
Uses a loop where each iteration selects the smallest element from the unsorted interval and moves it to the end of the sorted section.
