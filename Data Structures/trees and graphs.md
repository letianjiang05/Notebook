# Trees
- Trees are structures used to represent hierarchical relationship
- A tree
    - nodes
        - Root
        - Leaves
        - Internal nodes
        - Parent
        - Child
        - Sibling: Same parent
        - Ancestor: Parent or parent's parent
        - Descendant: Child or child's child
    - edges
        - (u, v)
    - Subtree
    - Level: Distance from root
    - Height: Layers
- Binary tree: Each node has at most two children
    - Left child
    - Right child
    - $ n \leq 2^h - 1 $
    - $ h \geq \log_2(n + 1) $
- Full binary tree: Every node has either 0 or 2 children
    - Nodes at level i: $ 2^i $
    - Total nodes: $ 2^{h} - 1 $

- getElem
- Representation
    - Array-Based
        - index, item, left, right
    - Reference-Based

- Tree Traversal
    - Pre-order (prefix)
        - $ R \rightarrow LC \rightarrow LCC1 \rightarrow RCC1 \rightarrow RC \rightarrow LCC2 \rightarrow RCC2 $
        - visit node
        - recursively visit left subtree
        - recursively visit right subtree
    - In-order (infix)
        - $ LCC1 \rightarrow LC \rightarrow RCC1 \rightarrow R \rightarrow LCC2 \rightarrow RC \rightarrow RCC2 $
        - recursively visit left subtree
        - visit node
        - recursively visit right subtree
    - Post-order (postfix)
        - Can be computed efficiently using stack
        - $ LCC1 \rightarrow RCC1 \rightarrow LC \rightarrow LCC2 \rightarrow RCC2 \rightarrow RC \rightarrow R $
        - recursively visit left subtree
        - recursively visit right subtree
        - visit node
    - Level-order
        - $ R \rightarrow LC \rightarrow RC \rightarrow LCC1 \rightarrow RCC1 \rightarrow LCC2 \rightarrow RCC2 $
        - Traverse the nodes level by level

# Summary
- We have discussed 
    - the tree data-structure.
    - Binary tree vs general tree
    - Binary tree ADT
        - Can be implemented using arrays or references
    - Tree traversal
        - Pre-order, in-order, post-order, and level-order



# Graphs
- Graphs: $ G = (V, E) $
    - Vertices: $ V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} $
    - Edges: $ E = {(u, v), ...} $
- Adjacency: $ (u, v) \in E $
- Path: A sequence of vertices $ v_1, v_2, ..., v_k $ such that $ (v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E $
    - Simple path: No repeated vertices
- Cycle: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex
    - Simple cycle: No repeated vertices except the starting and ending vertex.
- Connected graph: There is a path between every pair of vertices.
- Connected component: Compose a disconnected graph.
- Complete graph: Every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
- Subgraph
- Weighted graph
- Directed graph
    - $ x \rightarrow y $
        - y is adjacent, successor, predecessor of x
- Multigraph: Multiple edges and self edges/loops.
- A undirected graph that is connected and has no cycle is a tree.
- A tree with n nodes have exactly n-1 edges.
- A connected undirected graph with n nodes must have at least n-1 edges.

|Implementation|Adjacency Matrix|Adjacency List|
|---|---|---|
|Directed|$ A[i][j] = 1 $ if $ (v_i, v_j) \in E $|$ A[v_i] = {v_j | (v_i, v_j) \in E} $|
|Weighted Directed|$ A[i][j] = w $ if $ (v_i, v_j) \in E $|$ A[v_i] = {(v_j, w) | (v_i, v_j) \in E} $|
|Pros|determine whether there is an edge from node i to node j in O(1) time|find all nodes adjacent to a given node j efficiently, If the graph is sparse, adjacency list requires less space|
