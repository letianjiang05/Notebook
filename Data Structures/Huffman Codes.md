# Problem
- Encode a message constructed from the symbols A, B, C, D, and E using a fixed-length code
- How many bits are required to encode each symbol? 
    - at least 3 bits are required
    - 2 bits are not enough (can only encode four symbols)
- How many bits are required to encode the message DEAACAAAAABA? 
    - there are twelve symbols, each requires 3 bits
    - 12*3 = 36 bits are required
