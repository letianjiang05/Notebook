# Switching characteristics of semiconductor devices
- Digital waveforms consist of voltage levels that are changing back and forth between the HIGH and LOW levels.
- **Rising edge** (or positive edge) happens when digital signal goes from LOW to HIGH.
- **Falling edge** (or negative edge) happens when digital signal goes from HIGH to LOW.
## Timing Diagram
A timing diagram is a graph of digital waveforms showing the actual time relationship of two or more waveforms and how each waveform changes in relation to the others.

# Sequential Logic Circuits
- Consists of both combinational logic circuits and memory elements.
- Memory elements are constructed **from bistable logic** circuits called ‘flip-flops’.
- Output depends on current inputs and previous output state.

- Synchronous Sequential Circuits: Outputs and state change depending on a special input (clock).
- Asynchronous Sequential Circuits: Outputs and state change as soon as an input changes.

## Bistable Elements
- Has two stable conditions (states).
- Can be used to store binary logic.

# Latch and Flip-Flop
||Latch|Flip-Flop|
|---|---|---|
|Clock|No clock input|Has clock input|
|can be in one or more stable states (bistable) and have one or more inputs that can be used to change the outputs|Yes|Yes|
|Trigger|(Controlled latch) Level-triggered|Edge-triggered|
# Latch
- When EN input is LOW, the output does not change
- Sequential circuits have outputs that depend on both the **present state** and the **sequence of past inputs**. To be able to remember past inputs, sequential circuits contain memory devices called **latches** and **flip-flops**.

- A latch is a type of bistable logic device.
- Can reside in either one of its two states, SET or RESET.
- SET: $Q = 1$
- RESET: $Q = 0$
## Latch as level-sensitive device
- Latch is a level-sensitive device, meaning the outputs change when the levels of the inputs change (LOW or HIGH).
- Another device we will look at in the next slide is flip-flop which is an edge sensitive device.
- An edge sensitive device means the outputs change at the edges of the triggering input called clock (CLK).
## SR Latch
Latch as level-sensitive device
-   Latch is a **level-sensitive device**, meaning the outputs change when the levels of the inputs change (LOW or HIGH).
- Another device we will look at in the next slide is flip-flop which is an **edge sensitive** device.
- An **edge sensitive** device means the outputs change at the edges of the triggering input called **clock (CLK)**.

### Active HIGH input SR (SET-RESET) latch
2 cross-coupled NOR gates.

|S|R|Q||
|---|---|---|---|
|$0$|$0$|$Q_0$|No Change|
|$0$|$1$|$0$|Reset|
|$1$|$0$|$1$|Set|
|$1$|$1$|$Q = Q' = 0$|Invalid|

### Active LOW input S’R’ latch
2 cross-coupled NAND gates.

|S’|R’|Q||
|---|---|---|---|
|$0$|$0$|$Q = Q' = 1$|Invalid|
|$0$|$1$|$1$|Set|
|$1$|$0$|$0$|Reset|
|$1$|$1$|$Q_0$|No Change|

### Gated SR Latch
- A gated latch requires and enable input EN for enable (G is also used to designate an enable input).
    - When EN is HIGH
        - the S and R inputs control the state of the latch just as discussed in previous slides.
        - functions normally as an SR latch
    - When EN is LOW
        - no change occurs.
        - the output Q does not change (the latch stores its previous output).
    - The input EN is to enable the latch to respond to new inputs S and R when the inputs S and R are ready.

### Gated D Latch
- A gated D latch has only one input D (data) and an input enable EN (enable).
- D input is HIGH, the EN input is HIGH
    - the latch will be set i.e. the Q output is HIGH.
- D input is LOW, EN is HIGH
    - the latch will reset i.e. Q = 0.
- When the EN is low
    - the output has no change.

# Flip-Flops
- Negative Edge-triggered: Has a not gate (bubble) at the clock input.
- A **flip-flop** is a bistable (two stable states) logic circuit that can store only one bit at a time, either a 1 or a 0.
- The output of a flip-flop indicates which bit it is storing.
- An **edge-triggered flip-flop** changes state either at the positive edge (rising edge) or at the negative edge (falling edge) of the clock pulse and is sensitive to its inputs only at this transition of the clock.

## D Flip-Flop
- D is HIGH
    - Q output goes HIGH on the triggering edge of the clock pulse
    - flip-flop is SET
- D is LOW
    - Q output goes LOW on the triggering edge of the clock pulse
    - flip-flop is RESET
- The flip-flop cannot change state except on the triggering edge of a clock pulse.

Positive Edge-triggered D Flip-Flop
|D|CLK|$Q$|$\overline{Q}$|Comments|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|0|$\uparrow$|0|1|RESET|
|1|$\uparrow$|1|0|SET|

![alt text](image-19.png)
The operation of a negative edge-triggered D flip-flop are the same as those of the positive edge-triggered device except that the falling edge of the clock pulse is the triggering edge.

## JK Flip-Flop
- J is HIGH, K is LOW
    - the Q output goes HIGH on the triggering edge of the clock pulse
    - the flip-flop is SET.
- J is LOW, K is HIGH
    - Q output goes LOW on the triggering edge of the clock pulse
    - the flip-flop is RESET. 
- J and K are both LOW
    - the output does not change from its prior state. It is in STORE operation.
- J and K are both HIGH
    - the flip-flop changes state. This is called TOGGLE mode.

| J(Set) | K(Reset) |$Q_n$ | $Q_{n+1}$ | operation  |
|---|---|---|------|------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0  | 0     | no change  |
| 0 | 0 | 1  | 1     | no change  |
| 0 | 1 | 0  | 0     | reset      |
| 0 | 1 | 1  | 0     | reset      |
| 1 | 0 | 0  | 1     | set        |
| 1 | 0 | 1  | 1     | set        |
| 1 | 1 | 0  | 1     | toggle     |
| 1 | 1 | 1  | 0     | toggle     |

![alt text](image-20.png)
- $Q_{n+1} = J \overline{Q_n} + \overline{K} Q_n$ 
- $Q(t+1) = JQ’ + K’Q$

### T Flip-Flop (Toggle flip-flop)
- T flip-flop can be built from JK flip-flop or D flip-flop.
    - $J = K = T$
    - $D = T \oplus Q$
- Changes output state at every active clock edge if the input T = 1. 
- If T = 0, the output stays the same. 
- T flip-flops are often used as counters.


| T | Q | Q+ | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 | 0 ||
| 0 | 1 | 1 ||
| 1 | 0 | 1 | Toggle |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | Toggle |

### Flip-flop with asynchronous inputs
- The D flip-flop and JK flip-flop discussed previously are called **synchronous inputs** because data on these inputs are transferred to the flip-flop’s output only on the triggering edge of the clock pulse. Hence, data are transferred synchronously with the clock.
- Flip-flops can have **asynchronous inputs**. These are inputs that affect the state of the flip-flop independent of the clock.
1. Preset (PRE)
2. Clear (CLR)
- Active LOW (indicated by bubbles)
    - $\overline{PRESET} = 0, Q = 1$
    - $\overline{CLEAR} = 0, Q = 0$
    - $\overline{PRESET} = 0, \overline{CLEAR} = 1, Q = 1$ (normal synchronous operation)
#### D flip-flop with asynchronous PRESET and CLEAR inputs
- A D flip-flop with asynchronous PRESET and CLEAR inputs are shown below.
- These inputs are active LOW (indicated by bubbles).
- These inputs must be kept HIGH for synchronous operation.

Timing Diagram 
- When active-LOW PRESET = 0, the output of D flip-flop is SET (Q=1).
- Active-LOW CLEAR = 0, the output of D flip-flop is RESET or CLEAR (Q=0).
- When active-LOW CLEAR and PRESET are both HIGH, normal synchronous operation of D flip-flop takes place.

# Propagation Delay
- The interval of time required after an input signal has been applied for the resulting output change to occur.
1. Propagation delay $ t_{PLH} $ as measured from the triggering edge of clock pulse to the LOW-to-HIGH transition at the output. 
2. Propagation delay $ t_{PHL} $ as measured from the triggering edge of clock pulse to the HIGH-to-LOW  transition at the output. 
- Setup time $ t_s $ is the minimum interval required for the logic levels to be maintained constantly on the inputs (J and K, or D) prior to the triggering edge of the clock pulse in order for the levels to be reliably clocked into the flip-flop.
- Hold time $ t_h $ is the minimum interval required for the logic levels to remain on the inputs after the triggering edge of the clock pulse in order for the levels to be reliably clocked into the flip-flop.

# FF Applications
- Bounce elimination switch
- Shift Register
- Counters
- Frequency Division
- Memory circuits  etc.

- SR Latch – Application as Switch Debouncer
- Shift Register
A register is a group of flipflops which can store a group of bits. Lets consider a 4 FF register. Each of the four parallel data lines is connected to the D input of a flip-flop. The clock inputs of the flip-flops are connected together, so that each flip-flop is triggered by the same clock pulse. In this example, positive edge-triggered flip-flops are used, so the data on the D inputs are stored simultaneously by the flip-flops on the positive edge of the clock, as indicated in the timing diagram. Also, the asynchronous reset (R) inputs are connected to a common CLR line, which initially resets all the flip-flops.
- Counters
Counters are the sequential circuits that can count the events. Electrical pulses corresponding to the event are produced using a transducer/sensors and these pulses are counted to keep track of the no. of events.
Consider a 2-bit counter connected for asynchronous operation. Negative edge-triggered J-K flip-flops are used for illustration. Both flip-flops are initially RESET. Flip-flop A toggles on the negative-going transition of each clock pulse. The Q output of flip-flop A clocks flip-flop B, so each time QA makes a HIGH-to-LOW transition, flip-flop B toggles. The resulting QA and QB waveforms are shown in the figure.
