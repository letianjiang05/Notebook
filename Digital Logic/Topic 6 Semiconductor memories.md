# Memory
- The basic elements of a semiconductor memory is a flip flop in which the information is stored in binary form. 
- The size of a memory chip: $M \times N$ bits
    - $M$: no. of locations available in the memory 
    - $N$: no. of bits in each location.
- Each of the $M$ locations in the memory is defined by a unique address and for accessing an address requires $P$ address lines where $M=2^P$. This address line activates a certain location of the memory and then read or write operation is done.

# Advantages and disadvantages


# ROM (Read-Only Memory) and RAM (Random Access Memory)
volatile: describes a memory that loses its stored data when the dc power is removed.

# Flash memory
- The ideal memory characteristics
    - high storage capacity
    - nonvolatility
    - in-system read and write capabilitiy
    - comparatively fast operation
    - cost effectiveness.
- The traditional memory technologies above individually exhibit one or more of these characteristics
- Only flash memory exhibits all of them.
- Flash memories are high-density read/write memories that are nonvolatile, which means that data can be stored indefinitely without power. They are frequently used in place of floppy or small-capacity hard disk drives in portable computers. It is often called nonvolatile RAM. It has the property to “flash (erase)” a large block of memory.

A storage cell of flash memories consists of a single floating-gate MOS transistor (FGMOS). A data bit is stored as charged or the absence of charge on the floating gate depending if  a 0 or a 1 is stored.
