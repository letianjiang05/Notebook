# Digital and Analog
||Analog|Digital|
|---|---|---|
||The physical quantities or signals may vary continuously over a specified range.|The physical quantities or signals can assume only discrete values.|
|Values|An analog quantity has continuous value.|A digital quantity has a discrete set of values.|
||All signals occurred in nature are analog.|Used as representation of actual analog signals.|
||Cannot be used in modern computing devices.|Widely adopted because modern computing devices are digital.|
|Examples|A public address system|CD player|

# Pros
- Can be processed and transmitted more efficiently and reliably than analog data.
- Can be stored compactly and reproduced with great accuracy and clarity.
- Noise does not affect digital data as much as analog signals.
- Digital systems are scalable (meaning more transistors can be packed in smaller space at lower cost as technology matures.)
# Cons
- Need conversion
- More circuit blocks
# Binary Digit (Bit)
- Bit stands for Binary digit.
- Binary system has two digits either 0 or 1.
- Binary 1 = HIGH level
- Binary 0 = LOW level
- Groups of bits (combinations of 0s and 1s) are used to represents numbers, letters, symbols, instructions, etc.
- Nibble: A group of four bits.
- Byte: A group of eight bits.
## Usage
- Storage
- Communications
- Representation
- Data processing
# Digital Waveform
- Sequence of bits can be represented as digital waveform.
- HIGH, a bit 1 is present.
- LOW, a bit 0 is present.
-  Clock
    - The clock is a periodic waveform in which interval between pulses (called the period) is a constant.
    - In one $T$, the duration of HIGH pulse is equal to the duration of LOW level.
- Digital waveforms are often synchronized with a clock waveform in digital systems.
- Positive going transition (PGT): $LOW \rightarrow HIGH$.
- Negative going transition (NGT): $HIGH \rightarrow LOW$.
