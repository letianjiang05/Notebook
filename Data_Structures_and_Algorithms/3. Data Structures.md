# 3.1   Classification of data structures
- Logical structure
    - Linear
        - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables.
    - Non-linear
        - Tree
            - Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables, where elements have a one-to-many relationship.
        - Network
            - Graphs, where elements have a many-to-many relationships.
- Physical structure
    - Array-based implementations
    - Linked-list-based implementations
# 3.2   Basic data types

- Integer types: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`.
- Floating-point types: `float`, `double`, used to represent decimals.
