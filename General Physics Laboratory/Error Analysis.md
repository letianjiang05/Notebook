# Error Analysis

## Part I : Express number properly

### Significant Figures

* $$5.34 \rightarrow 3 \text{ significant figures}$$
* $$0.080 \rightarrow 2 \text{ significant figures}$$

## Part II: Systematic and random errors

### Systematic Errors

* Shift measurements from their true value by the same amount or fraction in the same direction all the time.
* Not affect the precision
* Affect the accuracy.
* From
  * A mis-calibrated device, or
  * A measuring technique which always makes the measured value larger/smaller than the "true" value.
* Example
  * Using a steel ruler at liquid nitrogen temperature to measure the length of a rod.
  * The ruler will contract at low temperatures and therefore overestimate the true length.
* Careful design of an experiment will allow us to eliminate or to correct for systematic errors.
* Rule of Thumb
  * Determine the uncertainty from measurement tools.
  * Digital instrument
    * The uncertainty = the minimum scale
  * Analog instrument
    * The uncertainty = the minimum scale
    * The uncertainty = the minimum scale/2 Are acceptable.

### Random Errors

* Shift each measurement from its true value by a random amount and in random direction.
* Affect the precision.
* May not affect the overall accuracy.
* Error is the discrepancy of a measured value from the true value.
* Uncertainty is the range of the possible errors for a measured value.
* Result of a measurement: $ x = x\_0 \pm \Delta x $
  * $ x\_0 $: the measured value
  * $ \Delta x $: the uncertainty
* Measurement
  * Single measurement: $ x = x\_0 \pm \Delta x\_{sys} $
    * $ \Delta x\_{sys} $: Minimum scale of the instrument
  * Multiple measurements: $ x = x\_{measured} \pm \Delta x $
    * $ x\_{measured} $: Mean of the measurements
    * $ \Delta x = \sqrt{(\Delta x\_{sys})^2 + (standard\ error)^2}$: Combined uncertainty
  * Sample Mean: $ \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} x\_i $
  * Standard Deviation: $ s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum\_{i=1}^{n} (x\_i - \bar{x})^2} $
  * Standard Error: $ SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n\}} $
  * Combined Uncertainty: $ \Delta x = \sqrt{(\Delta x\_{sys})^2 + (SE)^2} $

#### Rules for Stating Uncertainty

* Uncertainty can be expressed in one significant figure.
* $ 0.32 \rightarrow 0.4 $
* $ 72.6 \pm 0.4 $
* Accuracy: Closeness to the true value.
* Precision: Groupness of repeated measurements.

### Percentage of Error

* $ \text{Percentage Error}(%) = \frac{|x\_{measured} - x\_{true}|}{|x\_{true}|} \times 100% $

### Relative Uncertainty

* $ \text{Relative Uncertainty} = \frac{\Delta x}{x\_{measured\}} \times 100% $

### Percentage Difference

* $ \text{Percentage of Difference}(%) = | \frac{E\_{1} - E\_{2\}}{\frac{E\_{1} + E\_{2\}}{2\}} | \times 100% $

### Propagation of Error

* Direct Measurements:
  * measuring exactly the physical quantity that you're looking to measure
* Indirect Measurements
  * measuring the actual physical quantity by measuring something else
  * calculated using formula
